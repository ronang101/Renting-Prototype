# Renting Website Prototype

## Introduction
The Renting Website Prototype is designed to be a prototype for a platform that could revolutionize the way individuals find roommates and properties. By leveraging matching algorithms, it offers personalized recommendations to users, ensuring compatibility and satisfaction.

## Getting Started
To experience the platform users are required to create an account. Since this is only a prototype we only have a few human users, most are fake accounts, however, due to the ability to rent in any city in the UK it can be hard to find users due to filters, so below sets out how you must set up your account to see users.

### Account Creation *(The website is currently offline and the files require some configuration to run locally, feel free to email me for this configuration.)*
1. Visit https://renting-prototype-b75713326214.herokuapp.com/
2. Click on "Sign in with Google"
3. Fill in the required details, ensuring you meet the prerequisites listed below. The reason for these requirements is due to the way the website matches users. We look for users who fall within your selected age range, monthly budget range, looking in the same city as you, have some overlap in moving dates and you can also select to match based on university and occupation. Since this is only a prototype the fake users I have made fall within these ranges, hence why you must do the same. The prerequisites are here:

  
<table>
   <tr><td>Age:</td><td>20 - 28</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Monthly Budget:</td><td>500 - 1000</td></tr>
   <tr><td>City:</td><td>London</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Ideal Move-In Date:</td><td>Dates must be between 26/02/2024 - 25/03/2024</td></tr>
   </table>
  

4. Use the platform, please like any users you want and feel free to email me at ronanj.geraghty@gmail.com and I will make the likes mutual so that you can view matches.

## Notes
I took on this project as a way to learn more about web development and good coding practice. This project was used to display my coding ability, learn new concepts and learn how to write python and javascript in a standarized manner. Through previous projects I have created I noticed the code was very much written for myself and only myself, I have made many projects in R through my previous job, but even with further python and js projects the code is not very well organized and is not built for collaboration. Learning from my previous errors I wanted to focus on these previous weaknesses in this project in order to improve my ability to collaborate with others. 

All of the python code has been written accoridng to PEP 8 guidelines, the javascript code has been written according to standard javascript style guidelines. I have also designed my APIs to adhere to RESTful principles, however, there has been a few changes to the code recently which has impacted this RESTful approach so this will need to be fixed in the future. 

If you have read through any of the code or viewed the documentation you will see that the comments, docustrings and documentation is very comprehensive, I understand this may be overboard but it was more to go out of my way to ensure readability, take my time when writing code and improve my ability to write clean code.
