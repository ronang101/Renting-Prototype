# Renting Website Prototype

## Introduction
The Renting Website Prototype is designed to be a prototype for a platform that could revolutionize the way individuals find roommates and properties. By leveraging matching algorithms, it offers personalized recommendations to users, ensuring compatibility and satisfaction.
## Getting Started
To experience the platform users are required to create an account. Since this is only a prototype we only have a few human users, most are fake accounts, however, due to the ability to rent in any city in the UK it can be hard to find users due to filters, so below sets out how you must set up your account to see users.

### Account Creation
1. Visit https://renting-prototype-b75713326214.herokuapp.com/
2. Click on "Sign in with Google"
3. Fill in the required details, ensuring you meet these prerequisites:
  Age: 20 - 28
  Monthly Budget: 500 - 1000
  City: London
  Ideal Move-In Date: Dates must be between 26/02/2024 - 25/03/2024
  The reason for these requirements is due to the way the website matches users. We look for users who fall within your selected age range, monthly budget range, looking in the same city as you, have some overlap in moving dates and you can also select to match based on university and occupation. Since this is only a prototype the fake users I have made fall within these ranges, hence why you must do the same.
5. Use the platform, please like any users you want and feel free to email me at ronanj.geraghty@gmail.com and I will make the likes mutual so that you can view matches.
